# Go-CLI-Starter

This is a simple starter setup for a Golang CLI application, that is based on [urfave](https://github.com/urfave) and [Huh](https://github.com/charmbracelet/huh) at the same time, to provide a simple CLI approach, while offering interactive forms.


# Getting started

This repository uses [devcontainers](https://containers.dev/) to enable a simple development experience. All you need is [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Devcontainer VS Code Extension](vscode:extension/ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
